Mini web based weather client that, in the spirit of Jon Snow from GoT, knows nothing.

You can learn nothing about your weather here: https://kreddykhan.github.io/JonSnow/

Using this client you will know nothing about the actual weather in your location, but you will know a lot about not the weather in your location.

Built using George Martsoukos' Build a Simple Weather App With Vanilla JavaScript tutorial located [here](https://webdesign.tutsplus.com/tutorials/build-a-simple-weather-app-with-vanilla-javascript--cms-33893).

I only work on this weather site when I'm under the weather.
